# lazykh
Source code for the automatic lip-syncing project described in this video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3B8YqeLCpY

EDIT: The most recent version of the source code currently sits on a laptop I haven't turned on in 5 months. I tried to turn it on today, but it doesn't work anymore. And, I never backed up the files on it. Oops! (Interestingly, there is a copy of the source code on my desktop computer that does still work, but it is about 3 weeks older than the latest lazykh update (April 7, 2020 vs. April 14, 2020).) I'm debating between just uploading the 3-week-older code that I have access to now, or taking my laptop to an Apple Store IRL to get it fixed and see if I can get the files back. I'm leaning towards the Apple Store option, because if I can get the laptop running again, it's also the one place I've been able to run the entire lazykh process in one go. (Since the phoneme-detection library (gentle) only works on Mac OS!)

This may take a couple days, so please be patient!
